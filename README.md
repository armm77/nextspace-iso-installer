# nextspace-iso-installer
It is an ISO installation image (unofficial), modified to make an easy installation of the [NEXTSPACE](https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace) Desktop Project.
* Fedora Linux 42 [ISO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1btxJH80g0y8Rg2rgby_vhByumbD0BOqN/view?usp=sharing) image.

## Characteristics:
* Minimal installation x86-64.
* Default user configured `me` and his password is `nextspace`.
* By default the `root` user is free to set a password. (don't forget to do it in the installation)
* Option: [Standard](https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace/commits/master) installation, packages built from official sources.
* Installed packages will be updated frequently from [nextspace-packages](https://github.com/armm77/nextspace-packages)

## Installation Considerations:
* Do not select any other desktop (Gnome, KDE, etc.) to avoid conflicts with NEXTSPACE.
* Set the root user credentials.
* Network and disk settings are free for any changes.
* After installation, you can change the password for the "me" user.
